How to Set Up the Game: 
1. In configurations (for both server and client), set the Working directory to *./core/assets/* & classpath 
of module to *desktop_main*.
2. Start the server and let the window pop up. Then start the client.
3. If Client cannot connect, set a different DEFAULT_SERVER_PORT in NetworkManager.java
4. If Client still cannot connect, in *src/networking/NetworkManager.java*, set the DEFAULT_SERVER_IP to the one of your computer. See comments there.
